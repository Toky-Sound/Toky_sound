# Louis's adventrure 2

Louis began planning his journey towards the human city, as his master had asked him to find his old friend, Melandi, to deliver a magic box and convey his greetings. After descending the mountain, Louis arrived at a lakeside. To test his magical skills and seek further assistance, he cast a spell on a duck and a stone.

Suddenly, a miracle happened: the duck began to speak, and the stone became capable of moving freely. Louis looked at these two new friends with amazement, feeling that his magical training had not been in vain.

The duck introduced itself first: "My name is Ducky. It's nice to meet you."

Louis replied, "I'm Louis. I'm also very pleased to meet you."

Louis then turned to the stone, which could now move freely but did not know its own name. The stone looked at Louis and said, "I don't know what my name is. Could you help me choose one?"

Louis smiled and answered, "Of course. Since you are a stone that came to life, weâ€™ll call you Rocky."

The stone responded happily, "Thank you! Rocky is a great name!"

Next, Louis asked Ducky, "Do you know how to get to the human city?"

Ducky replied, "The human city is to the east. You must pass through a forest, fly across the sky, and travel beneath the sea to finally reach it."

Louis asked, "Why do we need to go through so many places?"

Ducky explained, "Each of these places holds different wisdom and challenges. Only by experiencing them can you truly understand the rules of this world and the meaning of life."

Louis realized this was part of the test his master had set for him, so he asked, "Can you guide me there?"

Ducky said, "Yes, I will guide you through the forest and help you face the challenges along the way."

Thus, after leaving the lakeside, they headed towards the forest in the northeast. As Louis looked at the dark and ominous forest ahead, he felt an unsettling premonition.
