# Louis's adventure 3

On the way to the forest entrance, Louis and his companions came across a wooden cabin. Upon closer inspection, they realized it was a shop selling various weapons and equipment. The shopkeeper was a middle-aged, bald man.

The shopkeeper said, "Hello, my name is Marquis. Welcome to my shop."

Louis said, "We don’t have any combat equipment. How about we buy some?"

Marquis replied, "That's right! Ahead lies the Dark Forest, filled with many monsters and dangers. It is said that in the deepest part of the forest, there is a very ferocious demon. 

If you want to pass through the forest, you will certainly encounter that demon. To defeat it, you will need proper equipment and weapons."

Ducky asked, "Do you have any weapons suitable for a duck?"

Marquis said, "Yes, I have a helmet and a sword that are perfect for a duck."

He brought out several items for Ducky to choose from.

Louis asked, "Rocky, do you need anything?"

However, Louis noticed that Rocky wasn’t responding. It turned out he was asleep.

Louis then asked, "I need some magical accessories. Where can I find them?"

Marquis said, "Oh! So you're a magician. 

I happen to have a powerful accessory called the ‘Blood Oath Bracelet’. It is said to be made from the blood of a demon from the deepest part of the forest, obtained by a brave warrior. 

It can greatly enhance your magical power."

Louis said, "Great, I'll take it."

Ducky also chose his equipment: a helmet and a short sword.

Louis asked, "How much is it all together?"

Marquis said, "That will be 3000 silver coins."

Louis looked embarrassed, thinking it was too expensive.

Marquis noticed Louis’s hesitation and said, "If you don’t have enough money, you can use that stone as collateral."

Louis asked, "Which stone?"

Marquis pointed to Rocky, who was sleeping on Ducky's back, and said, "That one."

Louis laughed and said, "No way, he’s my friend. And I do have enough money. Here’s 3000 silver coins."

Marquis accepted the money, smiled at Rocky, then said to Louis, "The truth is often late, but it may also never come."

Louis didn’t understand what Marquis meant, but he didn't mind.

They then left the shop and reached the forest entrance.

Ducky said, "I’ve lived near here for a long time, but I’ve never gone into the forest. It feels exciting, but we should be careful."

Rocky suddenly woke up and said, "What’s happening? Am I dead?"

Louis said, "Okay, we’re all set. Let’s go in!"

Rocky, still not fully awake, said, "What’s going on now!?"
